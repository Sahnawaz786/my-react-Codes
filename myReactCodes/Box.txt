Some deep learning about the components


here data acts as an objects where  n is a key and value pair

function App(data){
  return <div>data.n</div>;
}


<App n="1"/>   //we will pass samething to every function so that we dont have to write again and again and everytime n gets updated/overwritten


data={
    n:1
}


Note: 

  we can pass the attribute in the element

  so we have pass it 


In pre defined tags we have some restrictions and only limited attribute but in user defined tags we can do anything without any problem...
